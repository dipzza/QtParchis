# QtParchis

Spanish board game "Parch√≠s" implementation. Basic game logic is implemented on C++ with the intention of being independent enough to be easily usable in others projects or to change logic without touching the GUI code, GUI is done with Qt6 QtQuick with adaptative layout, graphical effects and a state system.
